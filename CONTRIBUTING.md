# Contributing to Webph.one
Hey, <b>thanks</b> for considering contributing to Webph.one!

Currently, the main step to start collaborating is to <b>join the [list](https://www.freelists.org/list/webphone-discuss)</b> and share with us <b>how you want to contribute and your skills/expertise</b> related. Then we will look together for the kind of collaboration that better suits both your interest and those of the project at this time. Please, add also any other information to <b>let us know you better</b>, such as your motivation to contribute, similar (or very different) experiences, things you like, etc.

Anyway, both if you already spotted where/how to contribute or if you still didn’t, you might find useful the following information:

● Where we are and where we plan to go: check [public_plans.md](https://github.com/saycel/webph.one/blob/develop/project_organization/project_plans.md)

● How we organize the work

● Who can give you specific support or guidance

## How we organize the work

<i>Note: The process described next has been used mainly for the app development. Many other tasks have been performed using alternative workflows upon discretion of the team.</i>

High level planning is exercised when needed to keep clearly identified at least the current and the next milestone. Its definition begins with the input of the representatives of the organizations that support the communities where we aim to deploy next. This conversation is completed by including the technical team’ perspective, starting by the prioritary user stories. An objective was to provide the team with a set of well defined user stories to feed the upcoming two-weeks sprint.

Once setted a milestone with its main features (or EPIC user stories), each EPIC is broken down into smaller user stories, and they are prioritized and detailed. Detail is added in a dialogue with the technical referent.

The tasks related with features development are mainly represented in this [kanban board](https://github.com/saycel/webph.one/projects/1). A couple of other tasks are also represented there, such as those related with issues with the release and the creation of environments for testing, development and production. As said, there used to be other things happening but not (yet?) represented there. Team members communicated their work by updating the items in the kanban.

You might also see issues that are not in the kanban. So far the team was taking them based on their criteria, and sometimes we took them out of there to the product backlog to keep the list clear and the focus.

## Who can give you specific support or guidance

Even though there is the list where you can write and will be seen for all the maintainers, you might also find valuable to know who to ask for an specific subject, so here they are:

● Rodrigo Monelos: my contribution to the project has been mainly as scrum master, product owner and tester.

● ...

## Your feedback is key for our improvement

Please notice that the way in which we were organized was until not long ago was, with lot of room for improvements, the one we could reach for a team somehow small and stable. Now we’re working on it to receive newcomers in a better way.
If you need more information than what we are giving, find difficult to collaborate or have suggestions for improvements, <b>please share it with us!</b>
